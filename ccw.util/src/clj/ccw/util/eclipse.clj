; From http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_are_IWorkspaceRunnable%2C_IRunnableWithProgress%2C_and_WorkspaceModifyOperation%3F
; FAQ What are IWorkspaceRunnable, IRunnableWithProgress, and WorkspaceModifyOperation?
; IWorkspaceRunnable is a mechanism for batching a set of changes to the workspace 
; so that change notification and autobuild are deferred until the entire batch completes. 
; IRunnableWithProgress is a mechanism for batching a set of changes to be run outside the UI thread.
; You often need to do both of these at once: Make multiple changes to the workspace outside the UI thread. 
; Wrapping one of these mechanisms inside the other would do the trick, but the resulting code is cumbersome,
; and it is awkward to communicate arguments, results, and exceptions between the caller and the operation to be run.
;
; The solution is to use WorkspaceModifyOperation. This class rolls the two mechanisms together 
; by implementing IRunnableWithProgress and performing the work within a nested IWorkspaceRunnable.
; To use it, simply create a subclass that implements the abstract method execute, 
; and pass an instance of this subclass to IRunnableContext.run to perform the work. 
; If you already have an instance of IRunnableWithProgress on hand, it can be passed 
; to the constructor of the special subclass WorkspaceModifyDelegatingOperation 
; to create a new IRunnableWithProgress that performs workspace batching for you.

; From http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Actions%2C_commands%2C_operations%2C_jobs:_What_does_it_all_mean%3F 
; Operations
; Operations arenâ€™t an official part of the workbench API, but the term tends to 
; be used for a long-running unit of behavior. Any work that might take a second
; or more should really be inside an operation. The official designation for operations
; in the API is IRunnableWithProgress, but the term operation tends to be used in its
; place because it is easier to say and remember. Operations are executed within an IRunnableContext.
; The context manages the execution of the operation in a non-UI thread so that the UI stays alive and painting.
; The context provides progress feedback to the user and support for cancellation.
; 
; Jobs
; Jobs, introduced in Eclipse 3.0, are operations that run in the background. 
; The user is typically prevented from doing anything while an operation is running 
; but is free to continue working when a job is running. Operations and jobs belong 
; together, but jobs needed to live at a lower level in the plug-in architecture 
; to make them usable by non-UI components. 

; operation : long-running action which will be executed outside the UI thread to not make it hang
; job : operation that run in the background. Jobs are usable by non-UI components
; Job: see also http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Does_the_platform_have_support_for_concurrency%3F
; jobs can report progress via instances of the UI-agnostic IProgressMonitor interface

; Article on jobs treating each and every aspect in depth: http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Concurrency/jobs-api.html

; CCW modelisation:
;
; Operation
; =========
; An operation is a function reporting progress via an IProgressMonitor
; (fn [progress-monitor] ....)
; The concept of operation is independent from the thread it may be running on
; (UI thread, background thread), is independent from the fact that the user actions
; may be blocked (modal, busy indicator then modal) or not (not modal, many flavors from unware (system), aware (closeable popup), informed (status line progress bar))
; and is independent from the fact that concurrency goodies (IRules, resource rules)
; have been declared or not to the Eclipse concurrency framework
